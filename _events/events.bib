	title={Higher Rank Series and Root Puzzles for Plumbed 3-Manifolds},
	author={Moore, Allison and Tarasca, Nicola},
	abstract={For a triple consisting of a weakly negative definite plumbed 3-manifold, a root lattice, and a generalized Spin^c-structure, we construct a family of invariants in the form of a Laurent series. Each series is an invariant of the triple up to orientation preserving homeomorphisms and the action of the Weyl group. We show that there are infinitely many such series for irreducible root lattices of rank at least 2, with each series depending on a solution to a combinatorial puzzle defined on the root lattice. Our series recover certain related series recently defined by Gukov-Pei-Putrov-Vafa, Gukov-Manolescu, Park and Ri as special cases. Explicit computations are given for Brieskorn homology spheres, for which the series may be expressed as modified higher rank false theta functions.},
