  title={Higher rank series and root puzzles for plumbed 3-manifolds},
  author={Moore, Allison and Tarasca, Nicola},
  abstract={For a triple consisting of a weakly negative definite plumbed 3-manifold, a root lattice, and a generalized Spin^c-structure, we construct a family of invariants in the form of a Laurent series. Each series is an invariant of the triple up to orientation preserving homeomorphisms and the action of the Weyl group. We show that there are infinitely many such series for irreducible root lattices of rank at least 2, with each series depending on a solution to a combinatorial puzzle defined on the root lattice. Our series recover certain related series recently defined by Gukov-Pei-Putrov-Vafa, Gukov-Manolescu, Park and Ri as special cases. Explicit computations are given for Brieskorn homology spheres, for which the series may be expressed as modified higher rank false theta functions.},

@article{Secant,
	abstract = {Inside the symmetric product of a very general curve, we consider the codimension-one subvarieties of symmetric tuples of points imposing exceptional secant conditions on linear series on the curve of fixed degree and dimension. We compute the classes of such divisors, and thus obtain improved bounds for the slope of the cone of effective divisor classes on symmetric products of a very general curve. By letting the moduli of the curve vary, we study more generally the classes of the related divisors inside the moduli space of stable pointed curves.},

@article{FT,
	abstract = {The classical Castelnuovo numbers count linear series of minimal degree and fixed dimension on a general curve, in the case when this number is finite. For pencils, that is, linear series of dimension one, the Castelnuovo specialize to the better known Catalan numbers. Using the Fulton-Pragacz determinantal formula for flag bundles and combinatorial manipulations, we obtain a compact formula for the number of linear series on a general curve having prescribed ramification at an arbitrary point, in the case when the expected number of such linear series is finite. The formula is then used to solve some enumerative problems on moduli spaces of curves.},
