	title={Higher Rank Series and Root Puzzles for Plumbed 3-Manifolds},
	author={Moore, Allison and Tarasca, Nicola},
	abstract={For a triple consisting of a weakly negative definite plumbed 3-manifold, a root lattice, and a generalized Spin^c-structure, we construct a family of invariants in the form of a Laurent series. Each series is an invariant of the triple up to orientation preserving homeomorphisms and the action of the Weyl group. We show that there are infinitely many such series for irreducible root lattices of rank at least 2, with each series depending on a solution to a combinatorial puzzle defined on the root lattice. Our series recover certain related series recently defined by Gukov-Pei-Putrov-Vafa, Gukov-Manolescu, Park and Ri as special cases. Explicit computations are given for Brieskorn homology spheres, for which the series may be expressed as modified higher rank false theta functions.},

Assuming certain finiteness and semisimplicity conditions, we prove that such sheaves satisfy the factorization conjecture and consequently are vector bundles. Factorization is essential to a recursive formulation of invariants, like ranks and Chern classes, and to produce new constructions of rational conformal field theories and cohomological field theories.},

	abstract={We show that coinvariants of modules over conformal vertex algebras give rise to quasi-coherent sheaves on moduli of stable pointed curves. These generalize Verlinde bundles or vector bundles of conformal blocks defined using affine Lie algebras studied first by Tsuchiya-Kanie, Tsuchiya-Ueno-Yamada, and extend work of a number of researchers. The sheaves carry a twisted logarithmic D-module structure, and hence support a projectively flat connection. We identify the logarithmic Atiyah algebra acting on them, generalizing work of Tsuchimoto for affine Lie algebras.},

	abstract = {We compute the Euler characteristic of the structure sheaf of the Brill-Noether locus of linear series with special vanishing at up to two marked points. When the Brill-Noether number rho is zero, we recover the Castelnuovo formula for the number of special linear series on a general curve; when rho=1, we recover the formulas of Eisenbud-Harris, Pirola, and Chan-L{\'o}pez-Pflueger-Teixidor for the arithmetic genus of a Brill-Noether curve of special divisors.

These computations are obtained as applications of a new determinantal formula for the K-theory class of certain degeneracy loci. Our degeneracy locus formula also specializes to new determinantal expressions for the double Grothendieck polynomials corresponding to 321-avoiding permutations, and gives double versions of the flagged skew Grothendieck polynomials recently introduced by Matsumura. Our result extends the formula of Billey-Jockusch-Stanley expressing Schubert polynomials for 321-avoiding permutations as generating functions for flagged skew tableaux.},

We give a recursive description of the classes of the closure of these loci inside the moduli space of stable curves. For n ≤ 4, we express these classes using a generating function over stable graphs indexing the boundary strata of moduli spaces of pointed stable curves. Similarly, we express the closure of these classes inside the moduli space of curves of compact type for all n.

A similar result is proved for 2-pointed curves as well using explicit curves on elliptic ruled surfaces.},

It is well known that the class of the closure of the divisor obtained for n=1 spans an extremal ray of the cone of effective divisor classes. We generalize this result for all n: we show that the class of the closure of the locus of genus-two curves with n marked Weierstrass points spans an extremal ray of the cone of effective classes of codimension n, for n≤6. A related construction produces extremal nef curve classes in moduli spaces of pointed elliptic curves.},
