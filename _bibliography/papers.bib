	author={Moore, Allison and Tarasca, Nicola},
	abstract={For a triple consisting of a weakly negative definite plumbed 3-manifold, a root lattice, and a generalized Spin^c-structure, we construct a family of invariants in the form of a Laurent series. Each series is an invariant of the triple up to orientation preserving homeomorphisms and the action of the Weyl group. We show that there are infinitely many such series for irreducible root lattices of rank at least 2, with each series depending on a solution to a combinatorial puzzle defined on the root lattice. Our series recover certain related series recently defined by Gukov-Pei-Putrov-Vafa, Gukov-Manolescu, Park and Ri as special cases. Explicit computations are given for Brieskorn homology spheres, for which the series may be expressed as modified higher rank false theta functions.},

We show how these spaces globalize to twisted D-modules on moduli of principally polarized abelian varieties, and we determine the Atiyah algebra of a line bundle acting on them. We prove analogous results on the universal abelian variety. An essential aspect of our arguments involves analyzing the Atiyah algebra of the Hodge and canonical line bundles on moduli of abelian varieties and the universal abelian variety.},

We realize them as degeneracy loci in type D and deduce their classes in case of expected dimension. Thus, we determine a pointed Prym-Petri map and prove a pointed version of the Prym-Petri theorem implying that the expected dimension holds in the general case. These results build on work of Welters and De Concini-Pragacz on the unpointed case. Finally, we show that Prym varieties are Prym-Tyurin varieties for Prym-Brill-Noether curves of exponent enumerating standard shifted tableaux, extending to the Prym setting work of Ortega.},

When the Brill-Noether number rho is zero, we recover the Castelnuovo formula for the number of special linear series on a general curve; when rho=1, we recover the formulas of Eisenbud-Harris, Pirola, and Chan-L{\'o}pez-Pflueger-Teixidor for the arithmetic genus of a Brill-Noether curve of special divisors.

These computations are obtained as applications of a new determinantal formula for the K-theory class of certain degeneracy loci. Our degeneracy locus formula also specializes to new determinantal expressions for the double Grothendieck polynomials corresponding to 321-avoiding permutations, and gives double versions of the flagged skew Grothendieck polynomials recently introduced by Matsumura. Our result extends the formula of Billey-Jockusch-Stanley expressing Schubert polynomials for 321-avoiding permutations as generating functions for flagged skew tableaux.},
