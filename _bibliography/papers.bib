  title={Higher rank series and root puzzles for plumbed 3-manifolds},
  author={Moore, Allison and Tarasca, Nicola},
  abstract={For a triple consisting of a weakly negative definite plumbed 3-manifold, a root lattice, and a generalized Spin^c-structure, we construct a family of invariants in the form of a Laurent series. Each series is an invariant of the triple up to orientation preserving homeomorphisms and the action of the Weyl group. We show that there are infinitely many such series for irreducible root lattices of rank at least 2, with each series depending on a solution to a combinatorial puzzle defined on the root lattice. Our series recover certain related series recently defined by Gukov-Pei-Putrov-Vafa, Gukov-Manolescu, Park and Ri as special cases. Explicit computations are given for Brieskorn homology spheres, for which the series may be expressed as modified higher rank false theta functions.},

Since the Brill-Noether number is equal to -2, such a locus has codimension two. Using the method of test surfaces, we compute the class of its closure in the moduli space of stable curves.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to compute the class of the closure of the effective divisor in M6,1 given by pointed curves [C,p] with a sextic plane model mapping p to a double point. Such a divisor generates an extremal ray in the pseudoeffective cone of M6,1 as shown by Jensen. A general result on some families of linear series with adjusted Brill-Noether number 0 or -1 is introduced to complete the computation.},
