Member of the VCU <a href='https://geometryvcu.github.io'>Geometry Group</a>

<b>Research Interests</b>

- the geometry of algebraic curves, abelian varieties, and their moduli spaces

- quantum invariants of knots and 3-manifolds

- geometric realizations of vertex algebras

- modern Schubert calculus

Research currently supported by the NSF grant <a href='https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2404896'>DMS-2404896</a> and a <a href='https://www.simonsfoundation.org/grant/travel-support-for-mathematicians/?tab=awardees'>Travel Support for Mathematicians gift</a> from the Simons Foundation.

<b>Seminars</b>

I coorganize the following seminar series (most talks are now live-streamed online):

- the <a href='https://geometryvcu.github.io/seminarfuture/'>Geometry Seminar</a> at VCU

- the <a href='https://geometryvcu.github.io/studentseminarfuture/'>Student Geometry Seminar</a> at VCU

- the <a href='https://researchseminars.org/seminar/VCUcolloq'>Math Colloquium Series</a> at VCU
