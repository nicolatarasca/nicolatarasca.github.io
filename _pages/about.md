My research interests are centered around the following themes:

  the geometry of algebraic curves, abelian varieties, and their moduli spaces

  quantum invariants of knots and 3-manifolds

  geometric realizations of vertex algebras
 
  modern Schubert calculus

My research is currently supported by the NSF grant <a href='https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2404896'>DMS-2404896</a> and a <a href='https://www.simonsfoundation.org/grant/travel-support-for-mathematicians/?tab=awardees'>Travel Support for Mathematicians gift</a> from the Simons Foundation.

I obtained my PhD at the Humboldt University in Berlin and the Berlin Mathematical School, Germany, in 2012. Before arriving at VCU, I was at Rutgers University, USA, the University of Georgia, USA, the Fields Institute, Canada, the University of Utah, USA, and the Leibniz University in Hannover, Germany.
